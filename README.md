# SIS Seesaw Home Learning Codes Downloader
 Python 3 script to download individual PDFs of student Home Learning Codes for Seesaw
## Usage
 The input file should be the CSV from Seesaw with the Home Learning Code download links.  The output folder is where you want the PDFs to be saved.  I suggest doing a single class at a time to keep them organized by teacher and since it seems Seesaw rate limits how many files can be downloaded in a row.
 
 `PDF_downloader.py -i <inputfile> -o <outputfolder>`

 For help:

 `PDF_downloader.py -h`
